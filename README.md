# Hardware cost estimate

## About
This is my first Angular project. I made this project for job recruitment. You can add, search, edit and filter hardware cost estimate.

## Demo
Here is demo: [Link](https://haivex-hardware-costs-estimate.netlify.app/)

## Features
- sort data by column - single click on column header for ascending, double click on column header for descending
- drag & drop table rows
- print table
- edit and delete position
- filter data by category
- add your own category
- calculate cost and number of positions by category
- Data are saved in localStorage

## Run locally

- Clone this repository `https://github.com/Haivex/mdbootstrap-recruitment-app`

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
